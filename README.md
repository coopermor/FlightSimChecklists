# FlightSimChecklists

These checklists are intended to be used for flight simulation. They're being written for the aircraft in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 Premium Delux Edition. There is no reason they can't be used for other simulators.

These checklists are not intended for real world usage.

These checklists are focused on things in the game rather than the real world so things have been excluded like fastening seatbelts and windows.

Issues and pull requests are welcomed.
