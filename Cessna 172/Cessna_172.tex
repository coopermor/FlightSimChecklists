\section*{INADVERTENT ICING ENCOUNTER}
\begin{flushleft}
Turn pitot heat switch ON.\\
Turn back or change altitude to obtain an outside air temperature that is less conducive to icing.\\
Pull cabin heat control full out and open defroster outlet to obtain maximum windshield defroster heat and airflow.\\
Open the throttle to increase engine speed and minimize ice buildup on propeller blades.\\
Watch for signs of carburetor air filter ice and apply carburetor as required. An unexplained loss in engine speed could be caused by carburetor ice or air intake filter ice. Lean the mixture for maximum RPM, if carburetor heat is used continuously.\\
Plan a landing at the nearest airport. With an extremely rapid ice build-up, select a suitable "off airport" landing site.\\
With an ice accumulation of 1/4 ionch or more on the wing leading edges, be prepared for significantly higher stall speed.\\
Leave wing flaps retracted. With a severe ice build-up on the horizontal tail, the change in wing wake airflow direction caused by wing flap extension could result in a loss of elevator effectiveness.\\
Open left window and, if practical, scrape ice from a portion of the windshield for visibility in the landing approach.\\
Perform a landing approach using a forward slip, if necessary, for improved visibility.\\
Apprach at 65 to 75 KIAS depending upon the amount of the accumulation.\\
Perform a landing in level attitude.
